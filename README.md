# Snow Sensing 

This repository contains hardware and software designs for low(er) cost snow sensing stations. These next-generation snow monitoring stations enable collection of near real-time, physiographically representative water and energy balance observations in montane headwater catchments. These stations provide hardware for developing robust, low-cost, low-power snow monitoring networks in complex terrain to enhance the spatial representation of catchment snow-water-equivalent (SWE). They are meant to complement existing snow monitoring infrastructure (e.g., NRCS SNOTEL stations) and enable establishment of sensing locations that represent different combinations of aspect, slope, vegetation, and elevation. Site instrumentation is intended to capture key snow-energy-balance processes, including: snow depth, short- and long-wave radiation, soil moisture, and air temperature. 

## Hardware

This folder contains designs and specifications for sensors, dataloggers, communication peripherals, and components required for building a snow sensing station.

## Code

This folder contains the code used to operate the snow sensing stations, including data collection, data storage, and data communication. It also includes some useful sketches (Mayfly/Arduino code) for testing sensors and reading SD cards.
