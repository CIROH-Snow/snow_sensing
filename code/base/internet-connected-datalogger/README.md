## Example Code for Internet-Connected Data Loggers

Two examples are given in this folder. The first is for receiving and parsing data into Campbell Scientific (CS) data logger tables using a CR800. We recognize that the CR800 is no longer being sold by Campbell Scientific, but the code here should be adaptable to any other CS data logger.
This assumes that data logger is already connected to a network you've set up on CS LoggerNet. Make sure to use the [push_to_cr800](../mayfly/push_to_cr800) sketch for the Base Mayfly if this is how you will connect to CS HIS and the [satellite_varCode](../../mayfly_datalogger/telemetry/satellite_varCode) sketch for the satellite station Mayfly.

The other example given here is for using a Mayfly (that is separate from the Base Mayfly that aggregates data from every station) that has an [LTE Bee modem](https://www.envirodiy.org/product/envirodiy-lte-bee/) for publishing directly to [HydroServer](https://hydroserver.geoglows.org/browse). If you are doing this, you will need to use the [push_to_mayfly_lte](../mayfly/push_to_mayfly_lte) sketch for the Base Mayfly and the [satellite_varUUID](../../mayfly_datalogger/telemetry/satellite_varUUID) sketch for the satellite station.
Make sure to properly set up the LTE Bee before deployment. To do so, you will need to purchase a SIM card. We recommend [Hologram](https://store.hologram.io/). You will need to set up an account before the SIM card will work. Once you receive the SIM card and set up the account, follow the instructions in the following screenshot taken from the first three steps of EnviroDIY's "[Assembling the Mayfly Data Logger Electronics](https://www.envirodiy.org/knowledge-base/building-an-envirodiy-monitoring-station/)" instructions.
