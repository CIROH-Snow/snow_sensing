This file contains the code needed for operating a Mayfly at a "base" station that is connected to a LTE Mayfly 
that is using the code found in the "integrations" directory of this repository. You will need a programmed XBee S3B
in order to properly use this as well.

The data communicated to the LTE Mayfly is framed as follows:
@variableUUID=variableMeasurement;

The LTE Mayfly looks for an @ to know the UUID of the measurement being taken, such as snow depth, timestamp, shortwave radiation, etc.
The = tells the LTE Mayfly what the actual value of the measurement was, such as 500 for the snow depth in mm.
The ; notes the end of the measurement.
Consecutive variable UUIDs and measurements can be tacked onto the String. The LTE Mayfly will parse them upon reception.
Once the String for a satellite station's data is ready to be sent to the LTE Mayfly, an ending variable is added called "endofstation"
and it is set to 1. "@endofstation=1;" The LTE Mayfly uses this to know that there is no more data for the string that has
just come through, and that it can go ahead and call a table to log everything to.

Make sure to put these in an order that will not disable communication in your network.
For example, if you have a satellite station that cannot directly talk to your central station,
but it can talk to another satellite station that does have contact with the central station,
then you do not want to get data from the in-between station first because it will power down
after it's finished sending data, which will then no longer help communicate data from your far
station to your central station. Collect the data from the farthest station first (i.e. most

then the XBee won't try and tell me if it made contact with the other XBee. I'll know if I have contact
