# Libraries

This folder contains all the libraries needed for programming an EnviroDIY Mayfly datalogger for deploying a snow sensing station. **These libraries are a copy.** These libraries are a composition of what the EnvrioDIY team has developed and the libraries their code depends on - as assembled from https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Libraries. The copy of the libraries here represent versions that are known to work with the Version 1.1 of the Mayfly datalogger board and the program sketches provided in this GitHub repository. 

Given that the EnviroDIY team and the developers of these libraries are continually working on thier code, there are some libraries here that are not the most current version of the original developers' code. That means that after you copy these libraries over into your Arduino/libraries folder in your Documents, the Arduino IDE may ask if you would like to update the libraries you have. You should not do the update or at least update libraries manually and only update the libraries that you know will not have new coding that will interfere with the functionality of your Mayfly datalogger and the data logging sketches provided in this repository.

## What to do with these libraries

Copy the contents in this directory (folders and stand-alone files), and paste them into the "Arduino\libraries" folder on your computer. Your "Arduino\libraries" folder will most likely be found in the "Documents" folder on your computer, but may be in a different location if you chose to put it in a different location when you installed the Arduino IDE.

## Description of libraries

There are several libraries, and by extension, source code that is not used by the snow sensing code in this repository. For example there is code in the modular sensors library for various sensors that are not used by the snow sensing station. As recommended by the EnviroDIY team, we copied these libraries from the original EnviroDIY GitHub repository and have left in this repository for completeness. There are library dependencies that we were not familiar with that the modular sensors software has, and it also keeps the door open for adding additional sensors and applying the work done here to other hydrologic data collection implementations. It was safer to leave the entire contents in the repository rather than sift through what is needed and what isn't. 

Extra libraries will not occupy any extra space on your Mayfly because they will not be called, but they will occupy space on your computer's hard drive. There are discrepencies found between this directory of libraries and EnviroDIY's version. EnviroDIY may add new libraries as they expand their functionality. This repository has modified code and has some additional libraries in case you want to do some unique troubleshooting. Just keep in mind that the purpose of using the libraries found in this repository is for the implementation of a snow sensing station. We cannot guarantee that these libraries will function for other projects as code and hardware continue to develop outside this project. 

The following four sections provide descriptions of the various libraries found here as described by EnvrioDIY in their Libraries repository that this originates from (https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Libraries). These sections are taken directly from the README.md file found in that repository. Any special comments made in regards to these libraries, or additional libraries not found in the original EnviroDIY repository, that may be of interest are noted in *italics*. The links take you to where the libraries originate.

### These libraries are for basic components built into the EnviroDIYMayfly:

* [soligen2010 fork of Adafruit ADS1x15](https://github.com/soligen2010/Adafruit_ADS1X15) - Includes the drivers for the auxillary ADC [TI's ADS1115 chip](http://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) which is built into the Mayfly board. (The ADS115 is a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and digital comparator.)  This fork fixes bugs in the Adafruit version and should be used instead of the version direct from Adafruit. *This library is used extensively for the Adafruit ADCs on the Mayfly itself and the for the extras used for the pyrgeometers.*
* [EnviroDIY DS3231](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Sodaq_DS3231) - A fork of the Sodaq library which controls the [DS3231](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS3231.html) I2C Real Time Clock (RTC) built into the EnviroDIY Mayfly.

### These libraries are likely to be helpful when using the Mayfly as a sleeping logger:

* [EnviroDIY Modular Sensors](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors) - A class-subclass setup allowing many sensors to be called with the same commands.  This library is dependent on many of the other libraries listed here. *This library is where where everything really comes together for seamless datalogging, and the EnviroDIY team has done extensive work in making this library as functional and digestible as possible. All the primary source code for sensors and measurments are found here. Understanding the structure and function of this library is not necessary to successfully deploy a snow sensing station, but doing so will greatly help you troubleshoot and expand the work done in this project to other applications.*
* [Sodaq RTCTimer](https://github.com/SodaqMoja/RTCTimer) - Works with the DS3231 to easily perform scheduled tasks.  This library does not handle sleeping and is intended for use with a continously awake logger. *This library is used for the base station's Mayfly if you choose to do a networking telemetry setup of snow sensing stations with XBee radios.*
* [SdFat](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) - Communicates with the on-board SD card to read and save data on the microSD card.  This is a more efficient and more feature rich replacement of the built-in SD library. *This library is used in ModularSensors, but also in a utilities file that helps to download data from a microSD card.*
* [EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/EnableInterrupt) - Administrates and handles both "external" and "pin change" interrupts on the Atmel microcontroller built into the Mayfly datalogger.  This allows the Mayfly to sleep and save battery.  This library also works well as a controller for the versions of SoftwareSerial and SDI-12 linked below that have been stripped of interrupt control.
* [Sodaq PCInt](https://github.com/SodaqMoja/Sodaq_PcInt) - Another simpler library that can administrate pin change interrupts.
* [EnviroDIY_GPRSbee](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/GPRSbeeMod/tree/v1.2_hacked) - Communicates with the [Sodaq GPRSBee](https://www.seeedstudio.com/GPRSbee-rev.-6-p-2445.html#) to send data over a cellular network. This library is an older version of the Sodaq library that has been hacked to work with both rev0.4 and rev0.6 of the GPRSbee. Further work is required to make the current Sodaq GPRSbee library work on the EnviroDIY Mayfly.
* [Tiny GSM](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM.git) - A smaller GSM communication library that supports, among others, [Sodaq's GPRSBee](https://shop.sodaq.com/en/gprsbee.html), Digi's [LTE](https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/embedded-rf-modules-modems/digi-xbee-cellular) and [WiFi](https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/embedded-rf-modules-modems/xbee-wi-fi) XBees, and ESP8266 based WiFi-XBee's like [Itead's Wee](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Wee_Serial_WIFI_Module) or [DFRobot's Wifi Bee](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1279.html). This library is more compact (and possibly easier to use) than the [EnviroDIY_GPRSbee](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/GPRSbeeMod/tree/v1.2_hacked) and supports many more modules, but does not include direct support for putting the modems to sleep. The "ModemSupport" module of the [EnviroDIY Modular Sensors](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors) library adds that.

### These libraries are used to communicate with sensors and peripherals:

* [AltSoftSerial](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial) - Improved software emulated serial, using hardware timers for precise signal timing and availability of CPU time for other libraries to respond to interrupts during data transmission and reception. *This library is used for the MaxBotix sonar snow depth sensor.*
* [EnviroDIY SDI-12](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12) - Implements the [SDI-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDI-12) communications protocol that is used by a wide variety of environmental sensors. *The METER TEROS 12 soil sensors use the SDI-12 protocol, and by extension, this library.*

### These libraries are modified versions that are necessary in order to work together:

These modified versions are necessary because each of these libraries will try to simultaneously monitor all pin change interrupt vectors on any Arduino board causing compiler errors.  Instead of allowing them to handle interrupts on their own, these have been stripped of interrupt vector control and require an external pin change interrupt to set up their interrupts for them.  The modified versions are only necessary to use two or more of these together. Any pin that supports pin change interrupts can be used with these libraries, provided that you use [EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/EnableInterrupt) or another library to allow them interrupt control. These can also be used with other AVR boards (including the Arduino Uno, Mega, or Leonardo).

* [EnviroDIY SoftwaterSerial_ExtInts](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/SoftwaterSerial_ExternalInts)
* [EnviroDIY SDI-12_ExtInts](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/tree/ExtInts)

Instead of being controlled by an alternate library, these versions have been cropped to only look at only one interrupt vector each. This means they are each only able to operate on the specified pins rather than any pin that supports pin change interrupts. These will only work together with the listed pin numbers on the EnviroDIY Mayfly datalogger itself.

* [EnviroDIY PCInt_PCINT0](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/PcIntMod) - Will only work on pins D24-D31 (A00-A07)
* [EnviroDIY SoftwareSerial_PCINT12](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/SoftwareSerialMod) - Will only work on pins D8-D23
* [EnviroDIY SDI-12_PCINT3](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/tree/Mayfly) - Will only work on pins D0-D7
