# Code for a Basic Snow Sensing Station

This folder contains the Arduino sketch necessary for logging data on a Mayfly datalogger for a low-cost snow sensing station. All data will be stored on a connected microSD card, and there will be no wireless transmission of that data.

This is a basic snow sensing station with no telemetry.
