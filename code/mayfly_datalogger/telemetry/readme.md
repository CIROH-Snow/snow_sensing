For telemetering snow data from a snow station to a Hydrologic Information System (HIS), there are two scenarios to consider: where your station will be located has cellular service or it does not.

If the snow station is located in an area with cell service, and you wish to telemeter data to a HIS, you will be using the lte_hydroserver sketch. This sketch is setup to make posts to HydroServer [HydroServer Link](https://hydroserver.geoglows.org/browse) which is a generalized HIS that anyone can post hydrologic data to.
Other servers exist that the Mayfly is capable of posting to, such as Monitor My Watershed [Monitor My Watershed Link](https://monitormywatershed.org/), ThingSpeak [ThingSpeak Link](https://thingspeak.mathworks.com/), DreamHost [DreamHost Link](https://www.dreamhost.com/), and Ubidiots [Ubidiots Link](https://ubidots.com/).
You will need to properly set up an account on the server website and use the appropriate sketch. The ModularSensors library has included example sketches for publishing to ThingSpeak and Monitor My Watershed [Publishers Examples](../../arduino_libraries/EnviroDIY_ModularSensors/examples).
Note that these examples were created by EnviroDIY, and the sketch contains code for other sensors that are not used in the example LTE sketch in this repository folder. If you wish to publish to one of these servers rather than HydroServer, you will need to adjust their code to include all the sensors we've laid out.
