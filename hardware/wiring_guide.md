### Wiring Guide

The steps in this guide are meant to be completed after the construction is done. Follow the instructions in the ![Construction Guide markdown file](construction_guide.md) and the ![Soldering Guide markdown file](soldering_guide.md) before continuing here. Note that this setup assumes a Solperk charge controller ([Link](https://www.amazon.com/SOLPERK-Controller-Waterproof-Intelligent-Regulator/dp/B0946MWYPK?ref_=ast_sto_dp)) is being used. Your implementation may look a little different if using a different charge controller, but the principles are the same.

Necessary tools and hardware:
