## Hardware Purchase

This repository contains Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that list components you can use to construct a snow sensing station, their cost at the time the spreadsheets were created, and a URL link to where they can be purchased. The hardware spreadsheets contain all the hardware components that are part of the actual station deployment - including the deployment platform, sensors, dataloggers, power components, communications, etc. 

There are two spreadsheets that contain materials you can use to construct a snow station:

1. [**More expensive** (hardware_spreadsheet_campbellsci.xlsx)](hardware_spreadsheet_campbellsci.xlsx): You may choose use primarily Campbell Scientific hardware for your implementation, but it will be more expensive, as outlined in the "campbellsci" spreadsheet. Use this option if you already have or want to use components from a company like Campbell scientific. We provide information about Campbell Scientific products, but you may choose to substitute equivalent alternatives from other manufacturers.
2. [**Less expensive** (hardware_spreadsheet_not_campbellsci.xlsx)](hardware_spreadsheet_not_campbellsci.xlsx): If you want to build a snow sensing station without using Campbell Scientific equipment (except for a sensor cross-arm which we recommend purchasing from Campbell Scientific), consult the "not_campbellsci" spreadsheet, which will cost less. You may also choose to mix and match components from both spreadsheets to optimize your costs with equipment you may already have (for example, you may already have a Campbell Scientific tripod for mounting, but you elect to purchase a retail solar panel).

Both options use the same suite of sensor and the same low-cost [Mayfly datalogger](https://www.envirodiy.org/product/envirodiy-mayfly-data-logger/). Differences are in the deployment platform hardware and power components. Sensors used by the snow sensing station include:

The "highend" hardware spreadsheet that is also contained in the hardware folder is mainly a reference for comparing some of the alternative components we have selected to typical industry-grade components. Note that the "highend" spreadsheet is not intended to be used for the purchase and construction of a snow station. It is solely a reference for comparing the cost of possible low-cost snow stations to their more expensive counterparts.

These spreadsheets do not include the tools, USB cables, etc. that you may likely need to successfully construct, program, and install the station. Just make sure to read through the documentation before beginning to know what hardware or tools you'll need before moving on.
