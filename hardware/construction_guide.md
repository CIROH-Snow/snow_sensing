### Construction Guide

There are two principal methods of constructing the mast that will house all the sensors, enclosures, solar panels, etc.  
The first is to use a Campbell Scientific tripod: https://www.campbellsci.com/cm106b

The second is to use the platform equipment listed in the instrumentation costs spreadsheet that specifically does not use the Campbell Scientific equipment. This spreadsheet is found in this directory.  
You will save approximately $1000 by not just using the platform materials listed there, but also using other alternatives to  
Campbell Scientific hardware, such as solar charge controllers, solar panels, grounding kits, etc. 

This document will go over the construction of a mast that does not use Campbell Scientific hardware and how to assemble sensors and enclosures.

It will also cover to construct a central station for aggregating data from multiple snow satellite stations on a Mayfly and communicating that data to  
a Campbell Scientific CR800.

#### Low-cost Platform Setup

1. Take an auger and drill/dig a hole at least 20 inches into the ground.
2. Using a Sharpie, mark on the Teros sensors
