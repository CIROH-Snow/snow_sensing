### Construction Guide

There are two principal methods of constructing the mast that will house all the sensors, enclosures, solar panels, etc.  
The first is to use a Campbell Scientific tripod: https://www.campbellsci.com/cm106b

The second is to use the platform equipment listed in the instrumentation costs spreadsheet that specifically does not use the Campbell Scientific equipment. This spreadsheet is found in this directory.  
You will save approximately $1000 by not just using the platform materials listed there, but also using other alternatives to  
Campbell Scientific hardware, such as solar charge controllers, solar panels, grounding kits, etc. 

This document will go over the construction of a mast that does not use Campbell Scientific hardware and how to assemble sensors and enclosures.

It will also cover to construct a central station for aggregating data from multiple snow satellite stations on a Mayfly and communicating that data to  
a Campbell Scientific CR800.

#### Low-cost Platform Setup

1. Take an auger and drill/dig a hole at least 20 inches into the ground.
2. If you have not already programmed your Teros 12 sensors, you will need to do that now. Follow the instructions of step 4 in the Hardware Setup Steps in the Mayfly Datalogger Code ![markdown file](https://github.com/CIROH-Snow/snow_sensing/tree/main/code/mayfly_datalogger)
3. Once the sensors are programmed, insert each sensor at their different depths: sensor 'c' at 20", sensor 'b' at 8 inches, and sensor 'a' at 2 inches.
4. Cut about a 3-foot lenght of flexible aluminum conduit that you can run the sensor stereo jacks through and bury the hole.
5. Take the U-post and begin inserting into the location of where the mast will go using a sledge hammer or a fence post pounder.
