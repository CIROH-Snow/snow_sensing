### Snow Sensing Hardware

This folder contains hardware designs and specifications for snow sensing stations, including sensors, dataloggers, communication peripherals, power, and deployment hardware.

Specific guidance on soldering, wiring, and constructing the station can be found in their respective guide files in this folder. Any programming and software instructions are found in the "code" folder of the repository.

The hardware spreadsheets contain all the hardware components that are part of the actual station deployment. There are two spreadsheets that contain materials you can use to construct a snow station. You may use primarily Campbell Scientific hardware for your implementation, but it will be more expensive, as outlined in the "campbellsci" spreadsheet, or if you would like to build a snow sensing station without using Campbell Scientific equipment (except for a cross-arm), consult the "not_campbellsci" spreadsheet, which will cost less. You may also choose to mix and match components from both spreadsheets to optimize your costs with what you may already have (for example, you may already have a Campbell Scientific tripod for mounting, but you elect to purchase a retail solar panel).

The "highend" hardware spreadsheet is mainly a reference for comparing some of the alternative components we have selected to typical industry-grade components. Note that the "highend" spreadsheet is not intended to be used for the purchase and construction of a snow station as discussed here. It is solely a reference for comparing the cost of possible low-cost snow stations to their more expensive counterparts.

These spreadsheets do not include the tools, USB cables, etc. that you may likely need to successfully construct, program, and install the station. Just make sure to read through the README files and guide instructions before beginning to know what hardware or tools you'll need before moving on.
