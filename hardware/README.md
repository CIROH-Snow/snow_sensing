### Snow Sensing Hardware

This folder contains hardware designs and specifications for snow sensing stations, including sensors, dataloggers, communication peripherals, power, and deployment hardware.

Specific guidance on soldering, wiring, and constructing the station can be found in their respective guide files in this folder. Any programming and software instructions are found in the "code" folder of the repository.

The hardware spreadsheets all the hardware components that are part of the actual station deployment. The two spreadsheets contain different materials because there are two general approaches to the construction of these snow sensing stations. You may use primarily Campbell Scientific hardware for your implementation, but it will be more expensive. If you would like to build a snow sensing station without using Campbell Scientific equipment (except for a cross-arm), consult the "not_campbellsci" spreadsheet.

These spreadsheets do not include the tools, USB cables, etc. that you may likely need to successfully construct, program, and install the station. It should be clear what tools you will need for each step of the process.

Just make sure to read through the README files before beginning to know what hardware or tools you'll need before moving on.
