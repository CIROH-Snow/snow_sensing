### Snow Sensing Hardware

This folder contains hardware designs and specifications for snow sensing stations, including sensors, dataloggers, communication peripherals, power, and deployment hardware.

Specific guidance on soldering, wiring, and constructing the station can be found in their respective guide files found in this folder. Any programming and software instructions are found in the "code" folder of the repository.

The instrumentation costs excel file includes all the hardware components that are part of the actual station deployment.  
This means that it does not include other things that you may likely need to successfully construct, program, and install the station.  
You may need to make other purchases for tools, USB cables, etc. It should be clear what tools you will need for each step of the process.  
Just make sure to read through the README files before beginning to know what hardware or tools you'll need before moving on.
